## Installing and running

Tinodios is NOT a standalone app. It's a frontend, a client. It requires a [backend](https://github.com/tinode/chat/). See [installation instructions](https://github.com/tinode/chat/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

**Important!** Due to Microsoft's (GitHub owner) policy of requiring developers of open source projects to [pay for for hosting large files on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-git-large-file-storage/about-billing-for-git-large-file-storage#purchasing-additional-storage-and-bandwidth), this repository cannot include prebuilt binaries for `MobileVLCKit` and `WebRTC-lib`. As a consequence, we do not include Pod files into repository. You need to install them manually:
```
pod install
```
or on Apple Silicon (M1):
```
arch -x86_64 pod install
```

## Push notifications

If you want to use the app with your own server and want push notification to work you have to set them up:

* Register at https://firebase.google.com/, [set up the project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) if you have not done so already.
* [Download your own](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client) config file `GoogleService-Info.plist` and place it in the `Tinodios/` folder of your copy of the project. The config file contains keys specific to your Firebase/FCM registration.
* Copy Google-provided server key to `tinode.conf`, see details [here](https://github.com/tinode/chat/blob/master/docs/faq.md#q-what-are-the-options-for-enabling-push-notifications).
